# Deep learning with Python: Personal workflow
This is my personal workflow with the ["Deep Learning with Python 2nd edition"](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition?a_aid=keras&a_bid=76564dff) book. This notebooks can also be found at [fchollet repository](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks) but here I try to tune every model that is presented.
